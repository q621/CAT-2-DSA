**Difference between array and linked list**
## According to memory allocation
- Arrays have contiguous memory allocation while linked list have non-contiguous memory allocation. Hence in linked list each node is allocated individually and linked via pointers and arrays all elements are stored next to each other.
- Arrays have a fixed size of memory allocation while linked list have a flexible growth.

## Performance
- Arrays have a random access e.g;O(1)direct access using index computation while linked lists have sequential access e.g;O(n)time required to access an arbitrary element
- In insertion and deletion issue of performance, arrays middle operation require shifting elements while linked list is generally efficient if the position is already known.

## Insertion and deletion
- Arrays end operation is efficient while linked list efficiency is known at positions.(at relevant node)
- Arrays middle or beginning require shifting elements leading to worst cases while linked list searching requires locating the correct node which may result in time coplexity
