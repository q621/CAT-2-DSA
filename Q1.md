**Rules of big O notation**
Big O notation describes the upper bound of an algorithm's time complexity

## Ignoring constants
- Coefficient and lower-order terms are irrelevant for larger input sizes
- When simplifiying the coefficient don't matter
    E.g;O(3n)simplifies to O(n)
        O(n+5)simplifies to O(n)

## Focusing on the Dominant Terms
- Only the terms with the highest growth rates matter
- Retain the terms with the highest growth rates
    E.g;O(n3+n2) becomes O(n3)
        O(n2+n) becomes O(n2)

## Iterative Loops
- Nested and single loops determine complexity
- E.g-Single loop interating n times is O(n)
      -Nested loops multiply complexity O(n*n) becomes O(n2)
